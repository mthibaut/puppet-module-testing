# Puppet-Module Testing autofs module

A module to help with the handson lab on puppet testing.
If used as a puppet module, this should be checked out as 'autofs'.

## Branches

There are a couple of special branches available:

* vagrant:  Includes a complete vagrant setup to develop on this module. You
            should probably not switch to that module when using this repo as
            a puppet module. It could get confusing.
* talk:     Includes some slides in reveal.js to go with the repo.
